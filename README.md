# AGB
 Average Game Bot is a discord bot similar to Dank Memer using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
# Invite
 You can invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1024848504784424960&permissions=1024&scope=bot)
# Features
 Working point system, global leaderboard, message count tracker (not a message logger, it just counts the amount of messages). New features are still being added.
# Notes
 There is a known bug where if less than 3 people have a score, and someone runs the leaderboard command, the bot will throw an error.
 Bot is temporarily not open source, it may be later. There is sample code in this repo for people looking to get started with discord.py, which includes sample commands for discord slash commands, buttons, and embeds.
 This github page is an issue tracker for the bot, although feature requests and bug reports may also be posted [here](https://discord.gg/C2UFcVdR).
